Unstake Hex on Ethereum tool
Mostly for learning purposes for now (while the hex subgraph is available at the link provided).
You can run the exe or the index.html file alone can be hosted/served somewhere at localhost or on a website, etc. Opening the html file from the fielsysem doesn't work.

1. Connect metamask wallet using ethereum 
2. Copy the graphql query and run it at the link provided
3. Copy the hex staking list results and paste them into the 2nd text box and click load stakes.
4. Use precaution :D
